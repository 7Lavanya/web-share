# Web Share API

**Date**: 2016-06-08

This site details a proposal to add an API to the web for sharing text, URLs and
images to an arbitrary destination of the user's choice:

```js
navigator.share({title: 'Example Page', url: 'https://example.com'});
```
* [Specification](https://wicg.github.io/web-share/)
* [Explainer document](docs/explainer.md), a high-level overview of the proposal.
* [Native integration survey](docs/native.md), for platform-specific matters.

This is a product of the [Ballista
project](https://github.com/chromium/ballista), which aims to explore
website-to-website and website-to-native interoperability.
