        This specification defines an API for sharing text, links and other
        content to an arbitrary destination of the user's choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The available share targets are not specified here; they are provided
        by the user agent. They could, for example, be apps, websites or
        contacts.

        Usage Examples
      </h2>
      <p>
        This example shows a basic share operation. In response to a button
        click, this JavaScript code shares the current page's URL.
      </p>
      <pre class="example javascript" title="Basic usage">
        shareButton.addEventListener('click', () =&gt; {
          navigator.share({title: 'Example Page', url: window.location.href})
              .then(console.log('Share successful'));
        });
      </pre>
      <p>
        In response to this call to <code>navigator.share</code>, the user
        agent would display a picker or chooser dialog, allowing the user to
        select a target to share this title and URL to.

        Share targets
      </h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn data-lt="share targets">share target</dfn> is the abstract
        concept of a destination that the user agent will transmit the share
        data to. What constitutes a share target is at the discretion of the
        user agent.
      </p>
      <p>
        A share target may not be directly able to accept a <a>ShareData</a>
        (due to not having been written with this API in mind). However, it
        MUST have the ability to receive data that matches some or all of the
        concepts exposed in <a>ShareData</a>. To <dfn>convert data to a format
        suitable for ingestion into the target</dfn>, the user agent SHOULD map
        the fields of <a>ShareData</a> onto equivalent concepts in the target.
        It MAY discard fields if necessary. The meaning of each field of the
        payload is at the discretion of the share target.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each share target may be made conditionally available depending on the
        <a>ShareData</a> payload delivered to the <a for="Navigator">share</a>
        method.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        Once a share target has been given the payload, the share is considered
        successful. If the target considers the data unacceptable or an error
        occurs, the target should either recover gracefully, or show an error
        message to the end-user, because the sender is not going to know that
        an error occurred. In other words, the <a for="Navigator">share</a>
        method is "fire and forget"; it does not wait for the target to approve
        or reject the payload.
      </div>
      <section class="informative">
        <h3>
          Examples of share targets
        </h3>
        <p>
          The list of share targets can be populated from a variety of sources,
          depending on the user agent and host operating system. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Built-in service (e.g., "copy to clipboard").
          </li>
          <li>Native applications written for the host operating system.
          </li>
          <li>Contacts (e.g., the user agent directly shares to a person from
          the user's address book, using a specific app).
          </li>
          <li>Websites (e.g., the user agent fills in a template URL with the
          fields of the <a>ShareData</a>, then navigates to that URL in a new
          browsing context).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
          There is an attempt to standardize the registration of websites to
          receive share data for that final use case; see <a href=
          "https://github.com/WICG/web-share-target">Web Share Target</a>.
        </div>
        <p>
          In some cases, the host operating system will provide a sharing or
          intent system similar to Web Share. In these cases, the user agent
          may simply forward the share data to the operating system and not
          talk directly to native applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mapping the <a>ShareData</a> to the share target (or operating
          system)'s native format can be tricky as some platforms will not have
          an equivalent set of fields. For example, if the target has a "text"
          field but not a "URL" field, it may be necessary to concatenate both
          the <a for="ShareData">text</a> and <a for="ShareData">url</a> fields
          of <a>ShareData</a> and pass the result in the "text" field of the
          target.

      <h2>
        Security and privacy considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        Implementations should observe the following security and privacy
        advice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Web Share enables data to be sent from websites to native applications.
        While this ability is not unique to Web Share, it does come with a
        number of potential security issues that may vary in severity
        (depending on the underlying platform).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>User agents MUST NOT allow the website to learn which apps are
        installed, or which app was chosen from
        <a><code>navigator.share</code></a>. This information could be used for
        fingerprinting, as well as leaking details about the user's device.
        </li>
        <li>On every call to <a><code>navigator.share</code></a>, the user MUST
        be presented with a dialog asking them to select a target application
        (even if there is only one possible target). This surface serves as a
        security confirmation, ensuring that websites cannot silently send data
        to native applications.
        </li>
        <li>Due to the capabilities of the API surface,
        <a><code>navigator.share</code></a> is <a data-cite=
        "WEBIDL#dfn-available-only-in-secure-contexts">available only in secure
        contexts</a> (such as <code>https://</code> schemes).
        </li>
        <li>Use of <a><code>navigator.share</code></a> from a <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_mode">private browsing mode</a>
        may leak private data to a third-party application that does not
        respect the user's privacy setting. User agents should consider
        presenting additional warnings or disabling the feature entirely when
        in a private browsing mode.
        </li>
        <li>The data passed to <a><code>navigator.share</code></a> may be used
        to exploit buffer overflow or other remote code execution
        vulnerabilities in native applications that receive shares. There is no
        general way to guard against this, but implementors should be aware
        that it is a possibility.
