        This specification defines an API for sharing text, links and other
        content to an arbitrary destination of the user's choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The available share targets are not specified here; they are provided by
        the user agent. They could, for example, be apps, websites or contacts.

        There is a theory which states that if ever anybody discovers exactly what the Universe is
        for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more
        bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already
        happened.
